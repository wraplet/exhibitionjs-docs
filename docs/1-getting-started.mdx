To use `exhibitionjs`, you need to set up your HTML structure and then initialize the `Exhibition` class.

## Installation

### Bundle everything:

```bash
npm install exhibitionjs monaco-editor @monaco-editor/loader
```

```javascript
// Using specific versions is recommended.
import { Exhibition } from "exhibitionjs";
import loader from '@monaco-editor/loader'
import * as monaco from 'monaco-editor';

loader.config({ monaco });
await loader.init();

// ...
```

### Loading `monaco-editor` from CDN

```bash
npm install exhibitionjs @monaco-editor/loader
```

```javascript
// Using specific versions is recommended.
import { Exhibition } from "exhibitionjs";
import loader from '@monaco-editor/loader'

// If you want to use the monaco-editor from a CDN.
loader.config({
  paths: {
    vs: 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/monaco-editor@latest/min/vs/'
  },
});

const monaco = await loader.init();

// ...
```

### No bundling. Loading everything from CDN

```javascript
// Using specific versions is recommended.
import { Exhibition } from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/exhibitionjs@latest/dist/+esm";
import loader from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@monaco-editor/loader@latest/+esm'

// If you want to use the monaco-editor from a CDN.
loader.config({
  paths: {
    vs: 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/monaco-editor@latest/min/vs/'
  },
});

const monaco = await loader.init();

```

## Usage

Basic HTML structure:

```html
<div data-js-exhibition>
  <div data-js-exhibition-editor data-js-options='{"monacoOptions": {"language": "html"}}'></div>
  <button data-js-exhibition-updater>Update</button>
  <iframe data-js-exhibition-preview></iframe>
</div>
```

Now that we have `monaco` module available, we can do:

```javascript
// ...

const monaco = await loader.init();

const defaultMonacoOptions = {
  value: "",
  minimap: {
    enabled: false,
  },
  scrollBeyondLastLine: false,
  automaticLayout: true,
};

Exhibition.createMultiple(document.body,
  Exhibition.getMap({
    configuration: {
      editors: {
        options: {
          monacoEditorOptions: defaultMonacoOptions,
          monaco: monaco,
        }
      }
    },
  }),
);
```

It will find proper elements in the document's body and will instantiate Exhibitions and their
dependencies based on them.
